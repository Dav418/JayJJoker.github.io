this is where all the css files for my websites are stored.

headerAndFooter.css is a common css file for bouth the header and footer.
this allows me to edit that file and the css for the header and footer will change
across all pages. this is because in the css for a page there is a
#include "headerAndFooter.css"; line which allows access to the css file
